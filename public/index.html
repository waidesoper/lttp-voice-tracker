    <h1>LttP Networked Item Tracker Featuring Voice Activation</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.4em;">Go to <span id="loc"></span>/[NAME] to view a tracker. If the name does not
        already exist, you will be able to create the tracker. If it does exist, you will be able to watch the
        tracker and, if the room creator gives you the passcode, update the tracker as well.</p>
    <p>If you have been given a passcode, you can enter it in the "Settings" panel by clicking the button in the
        lower-right hand side. There is no indication when you've entered the correct passcode, but you'll be
        able to update the tracker successfully if you did.</p>
    <p>Remember the passcode when you create a tracker. If your cookies clear, you will not be able to update
        the tracker without putting in the passcode.</p>
    <p>If you prefer a simpler version of the tracker, you can access one at <span id="loc2"></span>/simple/[NAME]
        that does not have map or chest tracking but does have a timer.</p>
    <p>Using Voice activation: in the settings menu is a voice settings section where you can toggle voice activation (if you are using Google Chrome)
        Allowing this will turn on the always listening tracker.
    </p>
    <p>There are 3 main modes to the voice tracker: items, dungeon items, and dungeon prizes</p>
    <p>items mode: say "Got X" where X is the item name, the tracker will speak it back to you and update the tracker</p>
    <p>dungeon items: to enter dungeon items mode say "Start X" where X is the dungeon name, items mode will now mark off chests as well
        To finish dungeon items you can say "finished" which will return to items mode, but won't mark the boss 
        as complete, or "killed boss" which WILL mark the boss as defeated
    </p>
    <p>dungeon prizes: say a dungeon prize followed by the dungeon to mark in the tracker, e.g. "Crystal Eastern".
        You can also mark meddallion requirements using the same method
    </p>
    <p>Adding new grammars: when recording an item or entering a dungeon, sometimes the voice recognition will pick up a different word
        The detected statement will show up in the "Last Heard" textbox in settings. You can select a mapping from the options list and click
        the "save grammar" button to add that mapping to your personal grammars list.
    </p>

                    thanks to Bonta0! This is a new feature, so if there are any problems, please either open an issue
                    or contribute a PR to the GitHub repo (PRs preferred, I have minimal time to work on this project).</li>

                    and "small keys" in options. Keys appear where chests normally do, so you will want to turn off chests.
                    If you have an existing room, you will need to either refresh or destroy it before this feature will work.

                    Major thanks to emerald000! Please report if you encounter any new issues, but most things
                    should be much improved now. The new logic options may have more bugs currently, though.
                </li>
                <li>Ganon's Tower tracker item [20 chests] added. (Agahnim tracker item reverted to only
                    tracking Agahnim 1 due to this change.)

                </li>
                <li>MP Upgrade and Bomb trackable items added.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>2017-09-24:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracker now supports any number or rows or columns for your layout. The method of modifying
                    layouts has changed slightly but it should be obvious enough.
                </li>
                <li>Bug fix for pushing a configuration: now, if you push a configuration, any browser going to
                    your tracker for the first time should use it. Configurations are also unique per room,
                    if you visit a large number of tracker rooms.</li>
                <li>"Use Tourney Configuration" button for tournament restreamers.</li>

        <li><strong>2017-09-06:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Agahnim now supports multiple modes for Aga 1, Aga 2, both, or neither defeated, to support
                    Entrance Randomizer users. Obviously chest logic doesn't account for every ER possibility but
                    this was an easy request to fulfill.

                <li>v26: Waterfall of the Wishing added.</li>
                <li>v26: Logic for not having a sword added to various dungeons.</li>
                <li>There is currently no support for 'swordless' mode in the chest tracking. I assume most people
                    doing this mode don't need chest trackers anymore. If this is a feature you would use however,
                    feel free to let me know.

                <li>You can now push your configuration to other instances of your tracker.</li>
                <li>Dungeon labels exist. You can turn them off in settings.</li>
                <li>Default now no sword. Swordless-specific logic to be added at v26 release.</li>
